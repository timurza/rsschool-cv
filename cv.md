## About me
    
    I'm 35 and i have been working as a civil engineer for 12 years and achieved everything i wanted in my profession.  I have considerable experience working in a team and excellent communication skills, enabling me to communicate effectively with a wide range of people through my work. I took part in different complicated projects which  required atypical decisions so i'm not afraid of hard work. Now i want to change my profession and do my best at frontend development as I am sure I can continue creating. I'm an energetic, dedicated person who has developed a mature and responsible approach to any task that I undertake.
