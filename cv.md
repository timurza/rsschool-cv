## About me
I'm 35 and i have been working as civil engineer for 12 years and got everything i wanted in my profession.  I've had good team experience and excellent communication skills, enabling me to effectively communicate with a wide range of people through my work. I took part at different complicated projects requiring atypical decisions so i'm not afraid of hard work. Now i want to change my profession and try myself at frontend development because i can keep creating another way. I'm an energetic, dedicated person who has developed a mature and responsible approach to any task that I undertake.
